--Wights are an odd duck amongst the undead, often not created by necromancers specifically, but instead rising of their own volition when the conditions are right. Wights are by no means individual souls, but often part of a gestalt; when a particular land has seen enough bloodshed - battlefields, forest, crypts and graveyards - wights can be seen to rise en masse, a near-physical representation of the battles and turmoil the land has faced. Sadly, it is for this reason that necromancers often facilitate the creation of wights regardless, for no other study or profession causes so much blood or death.

--Those who have had encounters with wights often describe them as indistinct skeletal figures, wrapped in flowing cloaks that become faded and incorporeal at their edges, while strange lights dance where their eyes should remain. Survivors tell of a peculiar sense of exhaustion when in close proximity to them, as though merely being close to these figments of death causes one's life force to sputter and fade. Regardless of this and their ghostly appearance however, it has been recorded that steel and strength of arms is yet enough to destroy them, or at least to erase them for the time being. It's just a shame that such battles are likely to simply create more of them in the long run...

--During my travels, I have noticed that some communities in the wild no longer bury their deceased as is the norm in larger settlements. Some folk burn the corpses of their fallen, committing their ashes to the earth instead. When asked why they perform this peculiar practice, I always receive the same answer: Necromancers. Fearful of their dead rising up to slay them at the whims of delusional, murderous filth, they believe that with the burning of the dead, their spirits are forever beyond the reach of a necromancer's bony fingers. Alas, this is not true. While fire may burn away a man's physical being, no flame can touch his spirit. Unfortunately, necromancers can. Bereft of both body and freedom, many souls are driven mad in the employ of necromancers, ceaselessly drifting through windswept crypts, harrying any unfortunate wanderers they encounter with a multitude of curses and hexes. Worst of all are those spirits who embrace their newfound purpose, causing them to grow in power at a frightening rate. No other being in Maj'Eyal is so obviously abhorrent to existence itself as these "dreads"; it is almost as though creation itself wants these beings gone from her world. It is my hope that you, and many others, oblige her wish.
