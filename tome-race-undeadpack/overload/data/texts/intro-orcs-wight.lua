return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.

You lived and died in the Clork Peninsula long ago.  Years went by, until the drums of war forced you to wake again.  Orcs, humans, giants, and stranger creatures clash across the land.  Almost by default, you found yourself siding with a peculiar community of free undead in the southeast of the Peninsula.

But now your adopted tribe is under the sway of the mad Nektosh.  You have no hope of stopping him without the help of the Orcs, but they are in danger from the steam giants of Atmos.

Thus, you have been sent to the Vaporous Emporium to wreak havoc and demoralize the giants.
For the Krimbul Clan!]]
