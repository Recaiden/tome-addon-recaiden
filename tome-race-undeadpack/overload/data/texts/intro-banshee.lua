return _t[[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.

You are a native of the northern region of the Allied Kingdoms, a peaceful land that both Humans and Halflings call home. You hail from the small town called Derth.  In an attempt to prove your worth, you have decided to venture into the old and wild places of the world, looking for ancient treasures and glory.

You were killed by bandits almost immediately.

But now you've returned from the grave to avenge your own death and achieve the greatness you set out for.  You'll find glory even if it kills you twice!]]
