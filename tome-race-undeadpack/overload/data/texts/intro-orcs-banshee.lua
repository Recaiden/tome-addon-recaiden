return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.

The minotaurs were not the only ones corrupted by the horrors of mana caves.  Though once human, you have joined the Krimbul clan, and like them, been transformed necromantically in order to preserve your sanity.

But now your adopted tribe is under the sway of the mad Nektosh.  You have no hope of stopping him without the help of the Orcs, but they are in danger from the steam giants of Atmos.

Thus, you have been sent to the Vaporous Emporium to wreak havoc and demoralize the giants.
For the Krimbul Clan!]]
