return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.

You died long ago, but that did not stop you. To escape true death, you transformed into an undead mummy.

But something is wrong: although your mind has survived the transition, your memories have not. You have no idea how much time has passed. You rise from your embalming table, covered in dust.  You feel safe here in this room, but who knows how the upper layers have fared?

You are in an old buried place - did you build it? - on the southern border of Shaloren lands. Escape this forsaken pit and try your luck in the wider world.]]
