return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Dreamdiver",
[[

The world exists in space: length, width, depth.  Over this, time flows forward at one second per second - except in broken places like Eyal.  Behind both space and time, magical energy permeates the ether.
But there are other realms, where none of this need be true.

You have found an ingress from another reality, and welcomed the creatures there, allowing you to create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Dreamdiver class#WHITE#.

Class features:#YELLOW#
- Artificial body with enhanced attributes and senses
- Extra equipment
- Make imaginary weapons real
- Distort reality with the power of the mind#WHITE#

Dreamdivers rely on Psi energy to manipulate the world.
The also use Exo Power, which is spent for almost everything but recharges quickly when not being spent.
