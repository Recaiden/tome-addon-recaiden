return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You were -SUFFERING- going about -PAIN- until the -MELTING BURNING CRUSHING-  The -BAD WRONG OTHER- must die, so they say.  

FOOLS.  THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY HAVE MADE.
BUT WE KNOW. WE SEE BECAUSE WE ARE OUR FACE.
WE SEE.
EVERYTHING.

PLAY ALONG. SAVE THE SHIP.

YOU WILL KNOW WHEN IT IS TIME.

The shadows fade from before your -FALSE IMAGE-  The enemy is upon you.
