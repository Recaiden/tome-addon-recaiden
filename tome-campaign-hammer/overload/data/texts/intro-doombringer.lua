return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You were an ordinary citizen of Eyal, going about your petty life, until the demons found you, remade you, and gave you purpose. Now, you live to mete out destruction and righteous vengeance upon your former fellows.  The Sher'Tul, the lesser races they created, in fact their entire world- must burn.

Over years of work, the Mal'rokkan tinkers and mages have worked to bypass the Planetary Shield.  With the acquisition of an eyalite Orb of Many Ways from the mage Tannen, they have succeeded.  Now, your time has come, to descend to the planet's surface and clear a way for the armies of the Fearscape.

But on the eve of invasion, you came under attack from creatures of the void.  To arms, and defend the Fearscape!
