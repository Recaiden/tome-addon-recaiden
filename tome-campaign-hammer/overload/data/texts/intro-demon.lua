return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You are Mal'Rokka, a demon.  You have lived your entire life aboard Goedalath, a titanic vessel shaped from the ruins of your homeworld.  Your entire existence has been training to fulfill your Father's mission of holy vengeance: the Sher'Tul and all they made must die.

Over years of work, the Mal'rokkan tinkers and mages have worked to bypass the Planetary Shield.  With the acquisition of an eyalite Orb of Many Ways from the mage Tannen, they have succeeded.  Now, your time has come, to descend to the planet's surface and clear a way for the armies of the Fearscape.

But on the eve of invasion, you came under attack from creatures of the void.  To arms, and defend your home!
