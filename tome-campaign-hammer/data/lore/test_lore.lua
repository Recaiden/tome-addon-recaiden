	lore = [[We are not people of great ambition or complex desires, we Minotaurs.  We seek not to choose a direction for the world, we wish not to spread across the land, we are content not to build great machines or greater empires.  What we wish more than anything is simply to live; alas, the rest of the world wishes that we do not.  We cannot say where or how the hostilities started...  if we had to guess, perhaps the soft-footed considered us a pest for seeking out homes in their storerooms and armories.  We are drawn to great magic, especially when it is concentrated into artifacts, and over the eons of persecution, we have developed an equally strong instinctual drive towards safe places underground (although, again, this is simply a guess).  If there is enough stray magic around, we can live on it without eating or drinking, and see no need to come to the surface; indeed, under such conditions we might not even age.  Most minotaur tribes that find a safe habitat - glowing with magic, and filled with enough dark twisting passages that the soft-footed will not come down in force - discover that they no longer need cooperation to survive, and slowly lose themselves to instinct; for a long time, it was only our willpower that made us different, and even that was beginning to wane.  In a way, maybe what happened to us was genuinely a blessing.

We cannot tell you how long ago it was, as we did not write down our history at that time, and we had more pressing concerns soon after.  At some point, though, we felt a home, better than any we'd ever felt before, through a long, long series of caverns and tunnels.  The magic here... it was incredible!  It...  well, you do not have a word for it, but "tasted" is close enough - different than anything we'd absorbed before, hearty and rich, and it soaked into our tired bodies so easily.  We did not even need to stop to rest, it kept us so rejuvenated...  so we kept going down, losing track of how far it was.  In truth, I think we walked the length of a continent, if not more, cheerfully pressing onward, eager to see what awaited us at the end.

If only we'd noticed that what we were feeling wasn't rejuvenation.

Our leader, Garnok of the Stormy Fist, was the first to fall victim to it, and if he hadn't done so in such dramatic fashion, we may have all been lost.  His eyes became frantic and wandering as we walked onward, and he began making odd, pained grunts before stumbling and falling.  We heard a crack, and suspected that he may have broken an arm; we dashed closer to him, but stopped when his back and shoulders bulged and shifted, shortly before several tentacles burst from him, covered in the blood, fur, and skin that they dragged with them.  He simply pushed himself up with these new appendages, as though nothing was wrong.

We backed away from him, and he grew wild, grabbing at Karbatha the One-Horned and surging that unfamiliar magic that saturated these caverns; at once, a strange creature burst forth, separating the two before hovering over us.  He made false promises to us as Nektosh ran to his sister's side, claiming that Garnok's fate was a gift, and asking us to join him.

We are simple, but we are not fools.  We ran; we felt a wave of magic surge forth, sickly like rotten meat, and Karbatha cried out in her brother's arms.  We kept running, as the tunnels bent back and forth, spiraling upward, until we were certain the creature had lost sight of us...  and then we heard a message in our minds.  "It's too late.  The blessing is already within you, and these tunnels are far too long to escape before it takes root.  Come back, so we can guide it into a form you will find pleasing."  And from deeper back in the tunnels, we heard a bellow from what used to be Garnok.

As we examined ourselves, feeling tiny hints of that blighted magic within us all, Nektosh took Karbatha away to a hastily-assembled tent, and she...  well, she was gone.  After the commotion ended, he strode out and gave a remarkably lucid assessment: the magic seemed to only work on the living.  Karbatha's illness stopped when her heart did...  and although it was certainly a drastic idea, if we couldn't purge this curse through some other means, we had to consider purging the life it fed on instead.

He was not our only necromancer, but the idea was still nearly unthinkable...  until we realized that it was growing.  There were no visible signs, our bodies and minds were resisting it...  but it was only a matter of time, and perhaps even less time for Nektosh.

We reluctantly agreed, and he prepared the spells and potions needed to keep us mostly as we were, but bereft of life.  Preserved, strong, even feeling and smelling when most liches could not..  but still cut off from Nature's gifts entirely, and still incapable of bearing young.  This generation would not age to death, but it would nonetheless be our last.  He volunteered to be the last one, only instructing another of us on how to convert him once all of us had been treated...  Whether it was because the infection had more time to fester within him, or because of what he suffered through in his sister's tent, Nektosh has never really been the same since then.

In a cruel twist of fate, we found what would have been paradise not long after our escape - the Mana Caves, laden with magic, but we only needed a tenth of it now as we did alive.  Nonetheless, it has been our home ever since...  most soft-feet would have raided the caverns and wiped us out like common vermin, but the Kruk Pride treated us with respect and dignity that perhaps no minotaur OR undead creature has received before (let alone the combination).  We are still a reclusive people, and our current state gives us even fewer reasons to need trade with them...  but they are the closest thing we have ever had to friends, and I suspect that right now, we are that to them as well.]],

The dawn of a new age is at hand, and it would do you no good to sleep through it.  Allow me to open your eyes, before I lead you to our ultimate destiny!

Unicorns!  I'm sure you know the story of these incredible creatures, their beauty and power.  The Humans know it too!  And the Orcs!  And the Steam Giants - they ALL had their own variants on this myth, a one-horned creature of incredible magical potential, but an elusive one.  For many years, I have told you that Karbatha and I were descendants of these "mythical" creatures, and you denied it!  For just as many years, I could not prove it...  but all that changed when the flying machine fell in the lake.  None of you foolish cowards wanted to go down and investigate, none of you - so I had to go down instead.

Fortunately, your ignorance paid off.  Without any of you other wastrels to scare it off, the unicorns of old myth, the creatures that have stayed hidden from me because you were all too close, finally found me in enough privacy to grant me their blessing.  Even still, they did not directly appear to me...  but in their own way, they awakened the power that it has always been my right to possess, the strength that has lied dormant inside me for so long.  And AWAKEN IT DID!

Look, to the south, at Frostgraze Mountain!  Do you see the hole through it?  THAT is my power, a mere side effect of what happened when some insolent swine dared to question it!  THAT is the power I have always had, the power I have always deserved, the power that shall now lead me to my rightful place over the Giants, the Orcs, and Nature itself!

Cheer!  CHEER, DAMN YOU!

Now...  as your new Lord, you are lucky that I am a merciful one.  I grant you all a tremendous honor, the opportunity to serve me and personally witness the fall of all who would oppose me.  Gone are the days of hiding from the Steam Giants, gone are the days of treating those Kruk Orcs as equals.  Gone are the days of the living claiming dominion over this world; they shall bow to us for the mercy of being made undead, or I shall personally annihilate them.  The living - and those who would not join me - shall be crushed under our hooves, and the world shall be ours!

I can feel it running out...  the voice spoke to me again, said "Warning, low energy, less than ten pulses remaining," and the energy that once flowed so beautifully through this artifact is beginning to grow cold.  No matter how much I beg and plead down in the lake, the unicorns will not come to me directly, will not tell me why I've angered them or what I could do for them to keep my power...  was this power ever mine in the first place...?

...  All right.  So, five to ten more uses...  I need to think about how this is going to work.  I've gone way too far to simply back out and act like everything should go back to normal - hee hee, can you imagine...  what do i do what do i do i can't keep stalling the conquest i can't come clean i can't win against the steam giants i can't i can't

someone just told me the giants attacked the orcs, the orcs won

I...  yes.  I've got a way out.  The Orcs must be weakened, wounded, easily dealt with or at least intimidated.  My people march on Kruk Pride, I arrange a meeting with the Giants and tell them the favor I did them, give them back the artifact if I can get it out of my horn without blowing my hand off...  they'll shelter me.  they'll give my people a plot of land.  they'll...  they'll do something that gives me some chance of not getting trampled by an angry mob...

i'm sorry karbatha]],
