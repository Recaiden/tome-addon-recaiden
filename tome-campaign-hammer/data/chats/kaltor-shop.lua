Ah, welcome, @playername@! #LIGHT_GREEN#*he yells in a voice loud enough to catch the attention of all in the shop, as he lifts his head to look around.*#WHITE# Yes, you heard me right, @playername@! The very same one who's been running rampant through the Vaporous Emporium is coming to ME for armaments! I don't think I could've asked for a stronger endorsement! #LIGHT_GREEN#*He looks back down to you, leaning over the counter to point out a glass display case loaded with exotic weaponry and armor.*#WHITE#
Well, I'm not one to turn down anyone with gold, and seeing as you've already made me rich, I'll even give you a discount, down to my pre-attack prices. #LIGHT_GREEN#*He leans in uncomfortably close, staring you in the eyes.* #WHITE#Or, if you came to do here what you did in the Emporium... #LIGHT_GREEN#*He directs his glare toward the multiple well-armed guards staring at you and standing still on the sides of the room.*#WHITE# I'm sure my #{italic}#emergency safety measures#{normal}# would just #{italic}#love#{normal}# an opportunity to try out their shiny new toys.]],
